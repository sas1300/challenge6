# Challenge 6:  *Weather Dashboard*

## What
 For this challenge we were instructed to create a dynamic weather dashboard.  When a person enters a city name into the text box and clicks the search button then the current weather condidtions for that city will be displayed.  Additionally, a 5-Day Forecast will also be shown.  
    
## Why
This challenge project not only provided a helpful application that we can use, but also a way to gain experience in using server side APIs.  By using server side APIs I will be able to get outside data to my site provide a dynamic user experience.  

## How
To create this Weather Dashboard the following were used:

* HTML
* JavaScript
* Jquery
* Bootstrap
* Moment.js
* fontawesome.com

## Sucessess & Challenges
During this project I found it very difficult to recall all of the information we have learned and apply it to creating a functioning and visually pleasing Weather Dashboard. I struggled with styling the dashboard and was not able to get the visual aspect to match the mock-up.   I did have success in getting the API functions working properly and was able to present the user with the most of the appropriate data.
